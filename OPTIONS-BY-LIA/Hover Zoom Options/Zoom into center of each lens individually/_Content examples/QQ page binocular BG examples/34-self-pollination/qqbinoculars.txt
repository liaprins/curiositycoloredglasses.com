Question: Why haven't all flowers evolved to self-pollinate exclusively?

Explanation: 

Only 5% of naturally occurring grape plants can self-pollinate; the others are either male or female plants exclusively and as a result produce far fewer grapes and ultimately far fewer seeds. Modern wine grapes were bred from the self-pollinating 5% for this very reason: the ability to consistently provide fruits for harvest.* What I don't understand is why only 1/20th of all grape plants have evolved in this way. It seems a much more efficient mechanism for passing along their DNA—and *all* of their DNA at that; no need to dilute it with half of another plants'. And given that they consistently produce more fruit and seeds, it would seem that they'd have easily surpassed the 5% mark over time. For that matter, why haven't all plant types evolved beyond the limits of male-female dependency? But I am especially baffled by grapes, some of which *have* evolved this mechanism, but seem to be stifled from taking over the grape-world. Maybe the male-female plant dynamic forces DNA mixing, which acts as insurance against genetic mutations and diseases?

This all according to the podcast "Science to the People"'s episode about wine... a very fascinating listen!
