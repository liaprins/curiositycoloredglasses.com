I"›<p>Moths could just come out during the day to get all the light they could ever want. They sure seem to like light when itâ€™s not a naturally occurring commodity. Does this mean something about the particular frequency of light they prefer? Maybe the sun doesnâ€™t specialize in the particular part of the visible light spectrum that they crave? Or is it more about the ratio of lightâ€”daytime is too intense for them? If so, this phenomena of light being available to them every nightâ€”thanks to human technology in the form of harnessed electricityâ€”is a very recent development within the long span of animal evolution. How has it affected moth behavior?</p>
