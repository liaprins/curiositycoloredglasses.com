I"ÿ<p>The short answer is yes. Mosquitoes do exhibit blood-sucking preferences, say the experts. ‚ÄúOne in 10 people are highly attractive to mosquitoes,‚Äù reports Jerry Butler, PhD, professor emeritus at the University of Florida. But it‚Äôs not dinner they‚Äôre sucking out of you. Female mosquitoes ‚Äì males do not bite people ‚Äì need human blood to develop fertile eggs. And apparently, not just anyone‚Äôs will do.</p>

<p>Who mosquitoes like best
Although researchers have yet to pinpoint what mosquitoes consider an ideal hunk of human flesh, the hunt is on. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a tremendous amount of research being conducted on what compounds and odors people exude that might be attractive to mosquitoes,‚Äù says Joe Conlon, PhD, technical advisor to the American Mosquito Control Association. With 400 different compounds to examine, it‚Äôs an extremely laborious process. ‚ÄúResearchers are just beginning to scratch the surface,‚Äù he says.</p>

    Beggars can't be choosers: mosquitos can be picky if there is a lot of warm blood to choose from, but if not, they will bite anyone.

<p>Scientists do know that genetics account for a whopping 85% of our susceptibility to mosquito bites. They‚Äôve also identified certain elements of our body chemistry that, when found in excess on the skin‚Äôs surface, make mosquitoes swarm closer.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPeople with high concentrations of steroids or cholesterol on their skin surface attract mosquitoes,‚Äù Butler tells WebMD. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that mosquitoes prey on people with higher overall levels of cholesterol, Butler explains. These people simply may be more efficient at processing cholesterol, the byproducts of which remain on the skin‚Äôs surface.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes also target people who produce excess amounts of certain acids, such as uric acid, explains entomologist John Edman, PhD, spokesman for the Entomological Society of America. These substances can trigger mosquitoes‚Äô sense of smell, luring them to land on unsuspecting victims.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a tremendous amount of research being conducted on what compounds and odors people exude that might be attractive to mosquitoes. With 400 different compounds to examine, researchers are just beginning to scratch the surface.</p>

<p>But the process of attraction begins long before the landing. Mosquitoes can smell their dinner from an impressive distance of up to 50 meters, explains Edman. This doesn‚Äôt bode well for people who emit large quantities of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAny type of carbon dioxide is attractive, even over a long distance,‚Äù Conlon says. Larger people tend to give off more carbon dioxide, which is why mosquitoes typically prefer munching on adults to small children. Pregnant women are also at increased risk, as they produce a greater-than-normal amount of exhaled carbon dioxide. Movement and heat also attract mosquitoes.</p>

<p>So if you want to avoid an onslaught of mosquito bites at your next outdoor gathering, stake out a chaise lounge rather than a spot on the volleyball team. Here‚Äôs why. As you run around the volleyball court, the mosquitoes sense your movement and head toward you. When you pant from exertion, the smell of carbon dioxide from your heavy breathing draws them closer. So does the lactic acid from your sweat glands. And then ‚Äì gotcha.</p>

<p>With a long track record ‚Äì mosquitoes have been around for 170 million years ‚Äì and more than 175 known species in the U.S., these shrewd summertime pests clearly aren‚Äôt going to disappear any time soon. But you can minimize their impact.</p>
