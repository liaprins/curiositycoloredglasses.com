I"ˆ<p>Four-wheel drive, all-wheel driveâ€”whatâ€™s the difference (assuming the all-wheel drive vehicle has just four wheels)? And amongst measly two-wheel drive vehicles, which is better under which conditionsâ€”front-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive? If one is always superior, why even manufacture the other variety? Iâ€™m on a mission to bring clarity to motor vehicle owners everywhere!</p>
