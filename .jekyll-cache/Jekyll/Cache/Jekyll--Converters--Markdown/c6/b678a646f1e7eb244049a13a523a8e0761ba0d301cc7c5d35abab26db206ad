I"Ê<p>Everytime I travel to the east coast for work, I become hyper-aware of the differences in the names of many of the cities and towns, compared to where I grew up in the Pacific Northwest. Whereas the west seems to be dominated by Native American names, the East is peppered with old-school Englishy-sounding monikers. It makes me wonder how correlated the various nomenclatures are to the dates of their citiesâ€™ founding, and the time and way in which the land they lay upon was acquired.</p>

<p>If I made a map categorizing each cityâ€™s name type, what would it reveal? Could I trace the borderâ€™s of each subsequent parsel of land purchased and instated to the Union by its cityâ€™s name types alone?</p>
