I"å<p>The date for Thanksgiving every year is unpredictable enough for me, and I know its formula: the third Thursday of every November. Yes, that feels arbitrary to me, but not compared to Easter. I do know that Easterâ€™s date is based on that of Passover, but then what is the calculation to determine Passoverâ€™s date, and how did that come to be? Are there other holidays around the world with opaque and unpredictable formulas determining when exactly theyâ€™ll be celebrated?</p>
