I"€<p>When I decided on a name for my blog, I realized I wasnâ€™t sure if I needed a hyphen between â€œcuriosityâ€ and â€œcoloredâ€. It seemed to me like those two words acted as a single concept Â to describe â€œglassesâ€,Â but I also realized I had never learned any rules in school about what that means in terms of hyphenation.Â Iâ€™ve noticed these sorts of dual-word descriptions (like the phrase â€œdual-word descriptionsâ€ itself) pretty often in various literary settings, but I never could pick up on any consistency with regard to hyphens or lack thereof, probably because no one else remembered this grammar lesson either.</p>
