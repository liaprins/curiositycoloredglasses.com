I"Ø<p>You know the drill: after you captured some sort of bug as a kid (or adult) you put it in a container, added grass, leaves, and sticks, and then <em>punched holes in the top to keep it from suffocating to death</em>. This implies an early understanding that insects breathe, just like other inhabitants of the animal kingdom. Well, maybe not <em>just like</em> other animalsâ€”how similar are insectsâ€™ cardiovascular systems to ours? Do they have lungs? Do water beetles have gills? They arenâ€™t usually red when you squish them (except mosquitoesâ€¦), so that would seem to imply that they donâ€™t possess iron-toting red blood cells to do the job of oxygenating their various bodily systems. So how do bugs breathe?</p>
