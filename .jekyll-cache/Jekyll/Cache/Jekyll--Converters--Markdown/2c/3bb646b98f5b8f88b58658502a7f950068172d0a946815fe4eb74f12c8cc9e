I"Å<p>When I had a manicure they took me over to a drying station, which did not have a fan, but did have UV lights. They told me to put my freshly painted fingernails under the lights to cure them. This worked, although I didn‚Äôt have a control to compare it to. In hindsight I should have only put one hand under and then compared my two hands‚Äô rates of drying‚Ä¶ maybe a good excuse to get another manicure, in the name of science! But assuming UV does act as a catalyst for curing nail polish, how does it do it? And does it have to be used exclusively with a certain type of nail polish containing special UV-sensitive ingredients?</p>
