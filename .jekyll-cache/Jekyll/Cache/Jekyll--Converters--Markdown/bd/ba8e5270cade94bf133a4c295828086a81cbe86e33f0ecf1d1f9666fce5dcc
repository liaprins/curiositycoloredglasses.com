I"À<p>Bicycles are the quintessential invention. I am continuously in awe of how far I can pedal before Iâ€™ve even had breakfast, powered by the glycogen in my legs alone. But I havenâ€™t quite mentally sorted out the physics behind these miracle machines. Pedaling means my legs still go up and down and forward and back in a way thatâ€™s much like walking, so how does adding two wheels and some gears to the equation make up so much distance?</p>
