I"Ã<p>Only 5% of naturally occurring grape plants can self-pollinate; the others are either male or female plants exclusively and as a result produce far fewer grapes and ultimately far fewer seeds. Modern wine grapes were bred from the self-pollinating 5% for this very reason: the ability to consistently provide fruits for harvest.* What I donâ€™t understand is why only 1/20th of all grape plants have evolved in this way. It seems a much more efficient mechanism for passing along their DNAâ€”and <em>all</em> of their DNA at that; no need to dilute it with half of another plantsâ€™. And given that they consistently produce more fruit and seeds, it would seem that theyâ€™d have easily surpassed the 5% mark over time. For that matter, why havenâ€™t all plant types evolved beyond the limits of male-female dependency? But I am especially baffled by grapes, some of which <em>have</em> evolved this mechanism, but seem to be stifled from taking over the grape-world. Maybe the male-female plant dynamic forces DNA mixing, which acts as insurance against genetic mutations and diseases?</p>

<p>*This all according to the podcast â€œScience for the Peopleâ€â€™s episode about wineâ€¦ a very fascinating listen!</p>
