I"Õ<p><a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> is, in the words of the <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/" target="_blank">foundation</a> behind it, â€œa flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual artsâ€. When I learned it as fledgling designer, I knew Iâ€™d caught the coding bug. <a href="http://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> is even better, because itâ€™s an adaptation of Processing that can be built into websites so that its outputs can be shared across the web! Keep an eye out for the p5-dependent interactive modulesâ€”or sketches as theyâ€™re called in Processing-speakâ€”across my Curiosity-Colored Glasses posts!</p>
