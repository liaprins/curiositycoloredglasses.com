I"Û<p>For example, in English we say and write â€œMunichâ€, but in Germanyâ€”the place responsible for the official name of that cityâ€”itâ€™s â€œMÃ¼nchenâ€. How are these alternative spellings and pronunciations determined when the native name is just thatâ€”a name, not necessarily a translatable concept? How did they come to be standardized enough to appear on maps?</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s up with English-speaking places calling it Munich, but Germans calling it MÃ¼nchen?</p>
