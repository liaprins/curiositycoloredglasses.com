I"§<p>Presumably it represents what the temperature feels like, after accounting for wind speed and maybe moisture levels, and Iâ€™m not sure what else. But what is the formula, and how did they arrive at it given that what something â€œfeels likeâ€ seems somewhat unmeasurable if you ask me. Or maybe it doesnâ€™t actually represent the perceived temperature, but weâ€™ve just been collectively interpreting it as that?</p>
