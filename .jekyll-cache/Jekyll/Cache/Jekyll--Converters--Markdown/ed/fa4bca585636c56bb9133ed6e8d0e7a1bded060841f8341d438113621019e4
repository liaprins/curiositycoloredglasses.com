I"è<p>You know those pens that make your handwriting look stunning, and bring out the best in all your doodled curlicues? If you donâ€™t, you really should get around to inventorying the worldâ€™s expansive supply of mark-making tools, and Iâ€™d urge you to start with the very affordable Pentel Rolling Writer. I admire Pentelâ€™s retro designs across much of their writing utensil portfolio, and the Rolling Writers are no exception. But what I truly adore about these pens are their ability to produce lines of variable widths, which is a rarity in the roller ball arena. I should say that this very trait Iâ€™m touting is what many loathe in a pen, so itâ€™s not for everyoneâ€”particularly if you tend to hold your pens at an angle approaching perpendicular to your writing surface, which will result in a very thin, scratchy stroke. But for those with very angled grips, the ink flows freely. I keep a Rolling Writer on-hand in every purse, backpack, glove compartment, and desk drawer I own.</p>
