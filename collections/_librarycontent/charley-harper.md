Charley Harper's prolific compendium of paintings, posters, murals, and more combine my love of the natural world with my fondness for modern geometric lines and grid systems. This digest serves as a visual stroll through Harper's career as an artist, biology book illustrator, and conservationist. I pull it off the shelf any time I need to simplify a visual concept or illustration.
