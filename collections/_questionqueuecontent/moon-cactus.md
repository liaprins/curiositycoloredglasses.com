question: Why do moon cacti have octagonal tops and triangular bases?
binocsize: medium

These cute little cacti are quite the conundrum for my hyper-geometrically and -biologically aware brain: their colorful round flower-like top halves are radially symmetrical in eight directions, while their green bases are radially symmetrical in only three directions. Three does not divide into eight nicely and I've never seen a plant that simultaneously supported both "symmetry types".
