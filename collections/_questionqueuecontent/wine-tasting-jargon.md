question: Is there any truth behind wine-tasting jargon?

Are there really any minerals or other compounds exclusively in common between wines said to be bearing "notes of apricot" and actual apricots? I believe we have the technological prowess to determine this, but not sure if it is worth it to do so … which means someone probably already has, and I want to find out about it.
